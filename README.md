# cpm_tutorial
Python-based tutorial on Connectome-based Predictive Modeling (CPM), prepared for Georgetown Methods Lab, December 2019.

This repo contains functional connectivity data for n = 337 subjects in a variety of task conditions from the Human Connectome Project, as well as associated behavioral data. The Jupyter notebook `cpm_tutorial.ipynb` demonstrates how to use CPM to predict behavioral measures from whole-brain functional connectivity, with a focus on exploring how rest and different task states differentially predict trait variables.

If you use CPM in your research, please consider citing the following papers:
